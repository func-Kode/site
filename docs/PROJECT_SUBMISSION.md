# üöÄ Project Submission System

This document explains the complete project submission workflow that allows users to submit their projects for showcase on the func(Kode) platform.

## üìã Features

- **Authentication Required**: Users must be logged in to submit projects
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client and server-side validation
- **Admin Approval**: Projects require admin approval before being displayed publicly
- **Featured Projects**: Admins can mark projects as featured for special highlighting
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users are redirected after successful submissions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and status feedback

## üîÑ User Flow

### 1. Project Submission (`/submit-project`)
- User visits `/submit-project`
- If not authenticated, redirected to `/auth/login?redirect=/submit-project`
- After login, user fills out the project submission form:
  - **Basic Info**: Title, Description, Detailed Description
  - **URLs**: GitHub repository (required), Live demo (optional)
  - **Metadata**: Tags, Primary Language, Category, Difficulty
  - **Author Info**: Pre-filled from user profile, editable

### 2. Submission Processing
- Form data validated on client-side
- POST request to `/api/projects` with authentication token
- Server validates user authentication and data
- Project stored in database with `is_approved: false`
- User redirected to `/projects` with success message

### 3. Admin Review (`/admin/projects`)
- Admins can view all submitted projects
- Approve/unapprove projects
- Mark projects as featured/unfeatured
- View project statistics (views, likes)

### 4. Public Display (`/projects`)
- Only approved projects are displayed publicly
- Featured projects shown in special section
- Filtering by category, difficulty, and search
- Links to GitHub and live demos

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Projects table (see database/schema.sql for complete schema)
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    long_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    github_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    live_url TEXT,
    tags TEXT[] NOT NULL,
    language TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    difficulty TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    views_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL schema in your Supabase dashboard:
```bash
# Copy contents of database/schema.sql to Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` includes:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/submit-project`
3. Log in with GitHub OAuth
4. Submit a test project
5. Check `/admin/projects` to approve it
6. View it on `/projects` page

## üîß Configuration

### Project Categories
Currently supported categories (defined in both frontend and database):
- Web App
- Mobile App
- CLI Tool
- Library
- Game
- AI/ML

### Difficulty Levels
- Beginner
- Intermediate

To add more admins, update the checks in:
- `/app/admin/projects/page.tsx`
- Database RLS policies in `schema.sql`
